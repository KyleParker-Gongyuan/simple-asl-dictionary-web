# Simple ASL Dictionary

This can technically be used for any yotube channel you want to turn into a dictioanry, sense we're technically downloading the video it will take a while for long vidoes.

Thats about it, it's meant as a simple dictionary to make learning ASL easier.

Happy signing! 

### DOCKER
Make sure to add your YT channel and that your database info is the same, everything else is plug and play.

for the [ASL_YT_CHANNEL] it has problems parsing some youtube channels with shorts, I know it works with https://www.youtube.com/[YOURCHANNELNAME]/videos

### W.I.P

[ ] A finger spelling trainer like https://www.asl.ms
[ ] A letter reminder
